# Evaluation Form Visualizer

### Story
--------------------------------

When I was a project management intern at Rogers Electric, I noticed there was no easy way to look at work order evaluation form data especially at a large scale. I proposed this project and completed it within the summer as a solo developer by closely communicating and cooperating with several departments.

### Summary
Hundreds of thousands of work orders summarized in less than a second with 15 useful filter options.

This application analyzed customer evaluation forms that are completed after every work order. The data was stored in flat files, so file reading and data analysis techniques
and strategies were implemented. This application brought to light data that was never previously looked at, and catalyzed the revision of the forms along with 
the project of switching the method of data storage. 

This application features many filters to allow the user to see necessary data and summaries. The application also exhibits the ability to export a report to PDF format.

Developed using Java and Swing.
