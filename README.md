# Evaluation Form Visualizer
This application analyzed customer evaluation forms that are completed after every work order. The data was stored in flat files, so file reading and data analysis techniques
and strategies were implemented. This application brought to light data that was never previously looked at, and catalyzed the revision of the forms along with 
the project of switching the data to be stored in a database. 

This application features many filters to allow the user to see necessary data and summaries. The application also exhibits the ability to export a report to PDF format.

Developed using Java and Swing.
